Directives
  ng-app: binds angular to the HTML page
  ng-model: binds angular to specific inputs
  ng-bind: binds angular to html tags
      {{this seems to be the same as writing ng-bind="input model name"}}
  ng-init
      initializes an AngularJS Application data. It is used to put values to the variables to be used in the application. In following example, we'll initialize an array of countries (using JSON syntax).
          <div ng-app = "" ng-init = "countries = [{locale:'en-US',name:'United States'}, {locale:'en-GB',name:'United Kingdom'},
              {locale:'en-FR',name:'France'}]">...
          </div>
      We can use this to init out activityList.

Controller
    a JavaScript object containing attributes/properties and functions. Each controller accepts $scope as a parameter which refers to the application/module that controller is to control.
